# link-to-page-widget
A really small widget created that will allow you to add a button to your sidebar

Originally created for a client website in early 2014, released now in case anyone finds it useful. 

This widget creates a button with the class .sidebar-btn which can then be styled using your theme's stylesheet. Each button can be set to link to either a specific page, or if using it a WooCommerce product category, allowing you to create your own "call to action" buttons for widget ready areas.

## Developers
This is not being worked on or supported by me. I may from time to time tweak it but of you would like a new feature, feel free to grab and amend accordingly :)
